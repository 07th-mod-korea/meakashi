# PS3 Voice and Graphics Patch (in progress)

Currently hosting only the automated placed lines. All files need manual fixing, avoid placing them on your game.

README's going to be updated as the patch is developed. Refer to our [wiki](https://github.com/07th-mod/guide/wiki) for more details about the patch.

Old collaborators welcome to join the repository, however it's still preferred to fork the repository and update through pull requests.

# Known issues (for fixing)

> in _meak_015_1.txt, pretty most of the starting script (until line 1000) is censored. The voice lines are still in because they're kinda close to the original. Leaving it there and changing the translation is up for discussion.

> in _meak_020.txt, S06/06/150601926 is also mildly censored, you know the drill.

> in _meak_021_2.txt, S06/06/150602076 is also mildly censored, so it should be worth to get a replacement.

> in _meak_024.txt, line 2900, the torture scene has no voices in the PS3 version.
